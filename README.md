# ManyHats

This 2D multiplayer platformer game was made for the University of Toronto Game Design and Development Club's Annual Game Design Competition.

The game was made with C++ and uses OpenGL/GLFW.  The objective is to launch as many hats at your enemy as possible and avoid falling off of the platforms.
